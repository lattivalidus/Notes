Display possibilities for Javascript

window.alert() will pull up a pop-up window with whatever you want written in it. This can probably be combined with an action, example also had math in it for some reason?

document.write() will re-write all html, can I combine with with a div to re-write the div? "should be used only for testing"

innerHTML
document.getElementById(id)


if using script in the body, must also put the script tag in the body as opposed to keeping it in the head like you would for css

you can use "//" to the left of script in a line to make notes or between /* and */. if using the // be sure that you are within the <script> tag or it may not be recognized by the html as a comment

Script is fucking case sensitive, fuck. by the way it also looks like it is run from top to bottom so if you have 2 items that identify the same thing, the farthest one down will be the one you see

hyphens are not allowed in javascript because it literally means "subtract"
